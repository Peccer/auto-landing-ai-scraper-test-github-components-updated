      "answer": "Traditional tools rely on fragile CSS/XPath selectors that break when layouts change. Our AI understands the content you want (e.g., product name, price, rating) and adapts across different templates and redesigns\u2014so you spend less time fixing and more time shipping."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need coding skills to use this?",
      "answer": "No. Describe your target data in plain English, paste URLs, and click run. For power users, low\u2011code options let you chain steps, add conditions, or integrate with your stack via API and webhooks."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can it handle dynamic sites, logins, and pagination?",
      "answer": "Yes. We use secure browser automation to render JavaScript-heavy pages, manage sessions, handle infinite scroll, follow pagination, and access authenticated areas you provide credentials for."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is web scraping legal and compliant?",
      "answer": "Scraping legality depends on the site and jurisdiction. We provide controls to respect robots.txt and rate limits you configure, credential vaults, and audit logs. Always review a site\u2019s terms and consult counsel for your specific use case."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate is the AI, and what if it gets something wrong?",
      "answer": "Most users see high field\u2011match accuracy out of the box. You can guide the AI with examples, enforce validation rules, and use review workflows to catch edge cases. Retries and auto\u2011corrections improve results over time."
